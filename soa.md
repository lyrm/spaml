# Spam Filter State of the Art
​
Email filters are used to manage incoming emails in order to detect and eliminate emails that contain spam or malicious code such as viruses, Trojans, or malware. Spam filtering is the security mechanism employed by email services at different layers of the network (in firewalls, email servers, email clients, or email user interface) to block unsolicited or suspicious emails.
​
The first email spam filter MAPS (Mail Abuse Prevention System) appeared in 1996 in the shape of a list called RBL (Real-time Blackhole List) containing IP addresses identified as being used for sending spam. MAPS is currently functioning as a part of [Trend Micro Email Reputation Services](https://www.ers.trendmicro.com). Following the MAPS initiative, the email providers designed various mechanisms for email spam filters to protect from the dangers posed by phishing, email-borne malware, or ransomware. These mechanisms are used to decide the risk level of each incoming email. Examples of such mechanisms include satisfactory spam limits, sender policy frameworks, whitelists and blacklists, sender reputation labelling and recipient verification tools.
​
The two common approaches used for filtering spam emails are knowledge engineering and machine learning. Namely, emails are classified as either spam or ham using a set of rules in knowledge engineering. Machine learning uses the knowledge engineering results in the model training phase for the classification of the training samples. Email spam filters employ various machine learning algorithms such as Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Decision Trees, Ensemble Classifiers, K-Nearest Neighbour, Rough sets, or Random Forests. Next we present the spam filters employed by the topmost email services: Outlook, Yahoo, Gmail.
​
Google's data centers make use of hundreds of weighted spam features to calculate the likelihood for an email to be a spam. The spam likelihood formula employed by Gmail uses state of the art spam detection machine learning algorithms such as natural language processing, logistic regression, neural networks, or optical character recognition for spam images. Moreover, machine learning algorithms are developed to combine and rank large sets of Google search results and users feedback allow Gmail to link hundreds of factors to improve their spam classification, from the formatting of an email to the time of day it is sent. To harness the amount of information, Google is using its in-house open source machine learning framework, [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), to help train additional spam filters for Gmail users. [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) makes managing large data easier, while the open-source nature of the framework means new research from the community can be quickly integrated. With the new filters in place as of 2020, [Gmail claims](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/ridding-gmail-of-100-million-more-spam-messages-with-tensorflow) to block now an additional 100 million spam messages every day containing linked images, hidden embedded content, or being sent from newly created domains that try to hide a low volume of spam messages within legitimate traffic.
​
Yahoo mail uses several algorithms and a combination of methods rooted in basic pattern matching techniques in the form of blacklisting, based on a complaint feedback loop service, and whitelisting in the form of a user's list of trusted correspondents. Moreover, Yahoo’s spam filters use reputation labelling that take into account factors such as: IP address, URL, Domain, Sender, Autonomous System Number (ASN), DKIM signatures, or DMARC authentication. We note that Yahoo keeps confidential the reputation labelling methods so we could only speculate that machine learning algorithms such as decision trees may be employed. The fact of the matter is that Yahoo announces having [user accounts monitoring](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN26995.html) mechanisms looking for suspicious activity, including from government-backed actors.  This may as well be a consequence of two incidents in 2016 when reports of Yahoo complying with a [government request](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/technology/yahoo-email-tech-companies-government-investigations.html) to scan user accounts  to identify certain suspicious patterns were followed by yet another [data breach attack](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2016/12/15/stolen-yahoo-data-includes-government-employee-information) when more than 150000 U.S. government employees personal informations were stolen. 
​
Outlook webmail service allows the users to send and receive emails in their web browser, connect cloud storage services to their account, and secure the email confidentiality via encryption or by disallowing the recipient's forwarding option. Outlook has its own distinctive methods of filtering email spams. The results of an [experiment available online](https://github.com/algorithmwatch/spam-bias/) show that Outlook classifies spam according to keywords present in the email. Microsoft declined to comment but it is likely that a machine learning algorithm identified specific keywords as a strong discriminator between spam and ham messages. Besides the internal anti-spam mechanism, the Outlook users or system administrators are [encouraged](https://www.lifewire.com/top-anti-spam-plugins-outlook-1173636) to add dedicated spam filters such as [SpamBully](https://spambully.com), which comes with a Bayesian ranking among other filtering mechanisms. 
​
In conclusion, machine learning algorithms have been extensively applied in spam filtering. However, when these algorithms are trained on poisoned data, it makes them a target for different attacks on the [reliability and accessibility of emails](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tygar/papers/SML/Spam_filter.pdf). The main glitch speculated by the attackers for poisoning is the regular re-training phase that uses new instances of undesirable activities. Nevertheless, real world systems such as financial fraud, or credit card fraud as well as spam detection systems make use of the poisoned data supplied by the attackers to detect attack sources by various methods such as Bayesian deep neural networks proposed by [Intel Labs](http://bayesiandeeplearning.org/2019/papers/112.pdf).
